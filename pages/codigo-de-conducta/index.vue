      <div class="page-simple__content">
        <p>We require that all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers of our conference agree to the following code of conduct.</p>

        <p>The organization will ensure compliance during meetings and events, and we expect the collaboration of all participants to help create a safe environment for everyone.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">The Quick Version</h3>
        <p>We want the conference to be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of their gender, gender identity or expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of any participant in any form.</p>
        <p>Sexual language or imagery is not appropriate for the event, including talks, Twitter, and any other communication medium.</p>

        <p>Participants who violate these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the organizers.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-3">The Not-So-Quick Version</h3>
        <p>We consider harassment to include offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity or expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

        <p>Sponsorships are also subject to this policy. Specifically, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Staff (including volunteers) should not wear sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from the meeting or conference.</p>

        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organization immediately.</p>

        <p>Organization members will be happy to assist participants in contacting venue security or local police, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe during the conference.</p>
        <p>We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules during the conference.</p>
