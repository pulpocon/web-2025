This session takes a hard look at what makes a good testing strategy. Instead of chasing meaningless metrics like 100% coverage, learn how to test behaviors, focus on integration points, and embrace a leaner, smarter approach to quality assurance. Your users donâ€™t care about how many tests youâ€™ve writtenâ€”they care about software that works. This is your guide to writing fewer tests, but better ones, that actually make a difference.'],

It is based on user interaction design, outcome-driven planning and mind mapping. Impact maps help delivery teams and stakeholders visualise roadmaps, explain how deliverables connect to user needs and communicate how user outcomes relate to higher-level organisational goals. (source: https://www.impactmapping.org/)',

It gives the group the means to verify the progress the whole time - to fail fast or stop investing because they have reached their goal.',
