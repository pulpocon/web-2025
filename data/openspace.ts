    'What is an openspace?',
    'It is an opportunity to explore new perspectives on a specific topic. Have you ever tried to empathize with someone on an issue you were sure you fully understood? In this openspace, participants will propose topics that will later be voted on by everyone. Once the topics of interest are defined, we will dive into enriching discussions, allowing every voice to be heard. The idea is to learn collectively, in an environment of respect and collaboration.'
