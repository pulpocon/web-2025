    'Events are a groundwork brick in modern software architectures, e.g. with Kafka as event broker. Events and messages should be designed corresponding to the API First principle as it is applied for synchronous APIs such as REST. Even though that requirement is obvious, AsyncAPIs are not widely known and are hardly applied.',
    'The talk presents an end-to-end approach, which can be used to design events on the base of event storming and context maps using AsyncAPI.',
    '  1. AsyncAPI â€“ a specification language for events and messages',
    '  2. An example with event storming',
    '  3. Definition of events out of a context map',
    '  4. Definition of the payloads',
    '  5. Message or event â€“ thatâ€™s the question',
    ' 6. Checklist when and where events can be applied'
